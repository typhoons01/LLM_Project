**Title:** Simple String Manipulation Program

**Objective:**

Create a Java program that performs basic string operations. The program should prompt the user for a string and then display the following:

- The original string entered by the user.
- The string converted to uppercase.
- The string reversed.
- The number of characters in the string.

The entire program should consist of only one Java class, and the final code should not exceed 20 lines.

**Assignment Details:**

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a string.

2. **String Operations:**
   - Display the original string.
   - Convert the string to uppercase and display it.
   - Reverse the string and display it.
   - Count and display the number of characters in the string.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The program must be contained in a single class named `StringManipulator`.
   - Use basic Java string methods for manipulation.
   - The final code should be no more than **20 lines** (excluding import statements and comments).

**Instructions:**

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Define a public class named `StringManipulator`.
   - Include the `main` method within this class.

2. **Implement the Program Logic:**
   - Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.
   - Perform the required string manipulations using Java's built-in string methods.
   - Ensure the output is clear and formatted as shown in the example.

3. **Sample Program Execution:**

   ```
   Enter a string: Hello World!
   Original String: Hello World!
   Uppercase String: HELLO WORLD!
   Reversed String: !dlroW olleH
   Number of Characters: 12
   ```

4. **Submission Guidelines:**
   - Submit a single Java file named `StringManipulator.java`.
   - Ensure your code is properly formatted and commented where necessary.
   - Test your program to make sure it works correctly.

**Notes:**

- Focus on using basic string methods such as `toUpperCase()`, `length()`, and character indexing.
- Remember that strings in Java are immutable; consider using a `StringBuilder` if needed for reversing the string.
- Keep your code concise to meet the 20-line requirement.
